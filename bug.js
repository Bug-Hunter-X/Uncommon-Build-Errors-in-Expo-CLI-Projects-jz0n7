This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that uses a custom build process or has dependencies that conflict with Expo's default build system. The exact error message may vary, but it often involves issues with native modules, build scripts, or package configurations. For example, you might see errors related to missing or incompatible native libraries, issues with linking native modules, or errors during the build process itself.  These errors can be difficult to debug because they often involve interactions between different parts of the project and the Expo build system.
