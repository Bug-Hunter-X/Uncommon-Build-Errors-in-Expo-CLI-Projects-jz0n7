# Uncommon Expo CLI Build Errors

This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon build error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error is characterized by difficulties stemming from custom build processes or conflicting dependencies which cause problems with native modules, scripts, or package setups.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file contains a simplified representation of a project that might trigger this type of obscure error.  The actual cause in real-world scenarios could involve several layers of dependencies, custom native modules, and intricate build processes.  These errors often manifest with unhelpful error messages making debugging intricate.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a possible solution which may vary depending on the root cause. In many cases, careful examination of the dependency tree, rigorous testing, and selective disabling of custom build steps might be essential to isolate and correct the problem.  In complex cases, it may be necessary to simplify the project's architecture or utilize more specialized debugging methods.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to build the project using `expo prebuild` or `expo start` (depending on your Expo setup).  You will likely encounter an error.
4. Review `bugSolution.js` to explore a potential solution approach (note that the specific solution will depend on the particular error you are facing).

This example offers a framework; real-world solutions may be more complicated.
