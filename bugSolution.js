Debugging these uncommon Expo CLI errors requires a systematic approach. Here's a strategy:

1. **Isolate the Problem:** Try commenting out sections of your code, particularly custom build scripts or native module integrations, to determine which part is causing the error.  Temporarily remove custom native modules one by one to see if that resolves the issue.

2. **Examine Logs:** Carefully analyze the error messages from the Expo CLI. Look for hints about the source of the problem. The error messages may point to specific files or dependencies involved.

3. **Dependency Review:** Check your `package.json` and review the versions of your dependencies. Ensure compatibility between different packages and search for known issues related to your dependencies and Expo.

4. **Simplify the Project:** If possible, temporarily remove less critical parts of your project to isolate the core components that might be causing the problem.

5. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning the project's build cache. This can sometimes resolve issues caused by outdated or corrupted build artifacts. On many systems, simply deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies is enough. 

6. **Expo's Documentation:** Check Expo's official documentation for any updates or known issues related to your situation. 

7. **Community Support:** Seek assistance from the Expo community or forums. Sharing specifics of your setup and the errors encountered might lead to helpful guidance.

The provided example demonstrates a general approach. Adapting these steps to your specific scenario is critical.
